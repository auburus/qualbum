Qualbum
=======

This pet project aims to help myself organizing the photos/videos I keep taking.

Right now it does nothing (yay!), but it aims to:

- Find duplicates of images
- Find duplicates of videos
- Help trimming down/deleting photos
- Help creating subalbums/summaries

As long as the project keeps growing, I'll update the readme accordingly.


#### Note
The code quality could probably be much better. There are two main reasons
because of that:

The first one, is that I actually started this project because I wanted 
to learn C# and GUI programming, something that I haven't done in my
life (except for some VBA, but that was awful). So, I know how to do
proper OOP in PHP (Yes, PHP, I know what you are thinking...), so
I will probably take a while until I figure how code is suposedly to
be organized in C#. That means, learning the good practices and so.

The second reason, is that I'm trying to develop this project in a different
way than usual, and that is results-driven. So, I'm aiming to what would be
called Minimum Viable Product (MVP), or getting something that actually works
first, make it beatiful, testable and organized later. We'll see if I succeed
on that.

Thanks for reading!
